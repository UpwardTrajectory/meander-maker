# Meander Maker

It's time for an urban themed walk! Perhaps you'd like to efficiently visit the nearest 4 bookstores, or build an itinerary for winetasting through a cluster of walkable tasting rooms. Anything is possible with Meander Maker.

### What the **Meander Maker** will do:
 * Build the shortest walking path between stops
 
 
### To Do:
