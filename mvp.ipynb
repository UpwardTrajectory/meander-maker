    "If you haven't ever used the `googlemaps` python package, there are a few small setup steps to take first. You'll need to install it by running the next cell. (If it runs something, but then looks like you have to choose `yes / no` then you'll need to run the commands in the terminal (without the `!` at the front.) Additionally, we will use `gmplot` to render the outputs and `polyline` to decode [Google's \"Polyline\"](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylineutility) hash. Finally, generate an API key to interface with Google's services. (There is a free tier, but if you use it a lot, they will start charging you for access.) Additionally, we will use `mapbox` from `Plotly Express` to get a different style of maps. This was mostly for development, but if you'd like to use that function, you'll need an api_key for that service as well."
